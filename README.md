# Hey, WTH?

Hi! I'm ManlosTech a student from the UK interested in web development and Linux stuff and server stuff. I'm mostly doing stuff to do with connecting apps on systems to websites now but I usually switch between that and other stuff. If you would like to contact me for a project I'm open at encryptforwarding@duck.com - obviously not my real email.
